## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL (v8 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Database Setup

```bash
# Create database and tables
sudo mysql < database/schema.sql

# Set up database user
sudo mysql < database/setup_user.sql

# (Optional) Load sample data
sudo mysql < database/seed_data.sql
```

### 2. Server Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Server runs on: `http://localhost:3001`

### 3. Client Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Client runs on: `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔐 Authentication

The app uses JWT-based authentication:

### Register
```
POST /api/auth/register
Body: { "name": "John Smith", "email": "john@scout.com", "password": "password123" }
```

### Login
```
POST /api/auth/login
Body: { "email": "john@scout.com", "password": "password123" }
```

The API returns a JWT token that should be included in subsequent requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user

### Players
- `GET /api/players?search=<query>` - Search players
- `GET /api/players/:id` - Get player details

### Dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard/:scoutId` - Get scout's tracked players
- `POST /api/dashboard` - Add player to dashboard
- `DELETE /api/dashboard/:id` - Remove player from dashboard

## 🔧 Configuration

### Server Configuration
Located in `server/index.js`:
- Port: `3001`
- Database credentials: `scoutapp` / `scoutpass`
- JWT Secret: Set via `JWT_SECRET` environment variable

### Client Configuration
Located in `client/vite.config.js`:
- Dev server port: `5173`
- API proxy configuration

## 📝 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server directory:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-in-production
PORT=3001
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=scoutapp
DB_PASSWORD=scoutpass
DB_NAME=scouting_portal
```

## 🧪 Development

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Server
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Client
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify MySQL is running: `sudo systemctl status mysql`
- Check credentials in `server/index.js`
- Ensure database and user exist

### Port Already in Use
- Change port in server or client config
- Kill existing process: `lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9`

### CORS Issues
- Verify CORS is enabled in `server/index.js`
- Check client is making requests to correct API URL
